# OpenGL Graphics Project
This program was developed using C++ and OpenGL to render the scene, which transitions between two different time periods. 
The graphics in this scene were programmed at a much lower level than other engine based programs I have created before, using a range of shaders. 
The features of this showcase include multiple post processing effects such as bloom and lens flare, as well as advanced rendering such as tessellation and cubemap SSR.
